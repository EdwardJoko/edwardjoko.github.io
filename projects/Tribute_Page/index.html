        <h3>Here's a time line of Max Planck's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1858</strong> - Born in in Kiel, Holstein with name Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1874</strong> - Began his studies at the University of Munich to study Physics. Although advised by Munich Physics Professor Philipp von Jolly to not going into Physics, saying, "In this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1879</strong> - Defended his dissertation, that titled <i>On the Second Law of Thermodynamics</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1880</strong> - Earned his habilitation that enabled him to teach in university and became an unpaid Privatdozent (German academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant professor) in Munich
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1885</strong> - Appointed by University of Kiel as Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Married his wife Marie Merck. And had four children, Karl, the twins Emma and Grete, and Erwin
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1889</strong> - Named to become the successor to Kirchhoff's position at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> - Proposed his solution to the problem of Black-body Radiation, that is the famous Planck Black-body Radiation Law. Relying on Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law. As Planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of Boltzmann's approach, his recourse to them was, as he later put it, "an act of despair... I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905</strong> -  Einstein used his theory to proposed a theory of The Photoelectric that light consists of tiny packets of energy known as photons or light quanta. That later the cause of Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905</strong> - Became the President of German Physical Society (Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, DPG) until 1909
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1907</strong> - Offered to have Boltzmann's position in Vienna, but turned it down to stay in Berlin
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1918</strong> - Received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on Quantum Theory
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1926</strong> - Retired from Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität and was succeeded by Erwin Schrödinger
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1947</strong> - Died	4 October aged 89 in Göttingen, Lower Saxony, Germany
          </li>

        <p>"He was, by nature, a conservative mind; he had nothing of the revolutionary and was thoroughly skeptical about speculations. Yet his belief in the compelling force of logical reasoning from facts was so strong that he did not flinch from announcing the most revolutionary idea which ever has shaken physics."</p>
